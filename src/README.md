How I built the mockup:

I decided to break the webpage up into components and start from the sidebar. I then did the nav bar and activity bar before focusing on the tabs. I used conditional rendering and useState hooks for the tabs to display the right information. I decided to make the webpage user responsive, hence I focused on making the css in terms of view width or view height, rather than just using pixels. This allows for the webpage to still render even when the user resizes the webpage, which helps the UX.

I utilised the data.json and mapped out the the information on the cards.

I utilised Figma to save the icons as svg so that the quality would not be affected despite resizing of the page. I also used the wireframe to ensure the layout and spacing is as alike as possible.
